üöÄ About Me
I've recently completed a 3-month internship at Merkle DACH, where I served as a junior Web Frontend developer. This opportunity followed the completion of an intensive 8-month programming course.

I consider myself a social person, always waiting for a joke, and in other hand I know how to be professional and responsible, obstinated for my goals.

I have always been around computers and technology. When I was at university, I found HTML and CSS, merging my longstanding passion for design with my interest in programming i dig deep in this world. 
By combining these skills, I aim to bring a discerning design eye to projects while possessing the technical know-how to execute them effectively. 
This vision of being a "unicorn" in the industry motivates me, as a Junior Frontend Developer, to being a change factor and to contribute the utmost to projects.
